# Android app for consulting projects from online database

This is a simple app made for a small company in portugal.

The app displays the data from a mssql database hosted online, this data is obtained from a php script that 
grabs the data from the database and does the conversion to json format.

Json result from the php script: http://ploran.gear.host/scriptobras6.php

The json string is then parsed by the application and displayed in a costumized listview.
